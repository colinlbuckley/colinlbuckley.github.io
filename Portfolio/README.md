### Colin L. Buckley

## [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis for Feature Selection - Titanic Kaggle Competition](https://colinlbuckley.github.io/Titanic_EDA)
* Explored Titanic passenger dataset with the aim of informing feature selection for Kaggle machine learning competition.
* Examined broad data characteristics (size, shape, variables, etc.).
* Performed visual EDA to explore univariate distributions and bivariate relationships between predictors and target variable.
* Implemented basic feature engineering to improve predictive strength later on.
* Investigated statistical relationships with preliminary multiple logistic regression model.
* Built a polished HTML notebook with RMarkdown for publication.
* Full repository available [here](https://github.com/colinlbuckley/Titanic_ML_Kaggle)

## [Project 2: International COVID-19 Vaccination Progress Comparator](https://github.com/colinlbuckley/vaccination_progress_app)
* Created an interactive Shiny web application in R that reads in a global vaccination dataset and visualizes vaccination progress between up to eight countries at a time.
* Built a simple UI with interactive inputs, allowing users to search for and select countries and dependent variables.
* Coded a reactive ggplot2 visualization that compares time series data across countries
* Adapted an R script to pull regularly updated vaccine data from Kaggle.com.
* Performed simple data cleaning and manipulation with dplyr.
* Hosted the app on shinyapps.io [here](https://colinlbuckley.shinyapps.io/vaccine_progress_app/)
